<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author of the following
discourse hopes it will appear from the perusal of it, that the
baptism of infants is a practice which he not only believes to be
scriptural, but which he warmly and devoutly loves.&nbsp; As a
parent, and as a pastor, one of his most delightful employments
has been the dedication of his own children, and of the children
of others, to the God of mercy.&nbsp; He endeavours also to
cherish in his own heart, and in the hearts of others, the
assurance that baptism is a sign of spiritual influences, which
our covenant God will graciously bestow upon our children, if we
disciple them to Christ by gospel instruction as well as by
water, and if we &ldquo;teach them to observe all things
whatsoever Christ has commanded.&rdquo;&nbsp; The connection
between our baptized households and church membership is so
intimate, that children should be trained for communion by the
parent, as well as by the pastor; and every baptized family
should thus strive to be a church of Christ, and seek to possess,
by the grace of God, a domestic as well as an individual
relationship to &ldquo;the general assembly and church of the
first-born.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were this made the object of more
anxious and prayerful effort, the degree of success, divinely
granted, would surprise and bless our hearts; the sacred
ordinance in which we delight, would be less ridiculed than it
is; the fatal mistakes which are made relative to it, would be
corrected; and it would soon become, as in primitive times,
universally practised.&nbsp; &ldquo;If infant baptism were more
improved,&rdquo; says Philip Henry, &ldquo;it would be less
disputed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following discourse is not put forth as a complete
treatise on the subject of baptism.&nbsp; It is the mere outline
<a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>of one
branch of an argument which is briefly stated, and which is not
even defended from the customary objections.&nbsp; It was
preached, and is now published, not so much for those who deny
the ordinance to their children, as for those who practice it; to
remind them of the privilege which they enjoy, and of the
consequent responsibility which they incur.&nbsp; Nothing is said
in the sermon about <i>the mode</i> of baptizing, because the
object which the preacher had in view did not require it; and
because, during the time of its delivery, he was desirous to
occupy the attention of his hearers with matters of more
importance than the question, Whether, in baptism, the water is
to be applied to the person, or the person to the
water?&mdash;though he believes that the former mode is more
scriptural and more seemly than the latter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As the discourse was occasioned by the
baptise of the Prince of Wales</span>, <span class="smcap">the
heir apparent to the British throne</span>, <span
class="smcap">it is now published with the earnest desire and
prayer</span>, <span class="smcap">that he may be spared
till</span>, <span class="smcap">at some distant day</span>,
<span class="smcap">he shall realize</span> &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">the true idea of a patriot king</span>;&rdquo;
<span class="smcap">and that the royal house into which he is
born</span>, <span class="smcap">may from one generation to

in righteousness</span>, <span class="smcap">and who</span>,

5</span>SERMON.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,</p>
<p>As it has been publicly announced that the infant Prince of
Wales will be baptized on Tuesday next, a suitable opportunity is
now afforded for directing your attention to the subject of
baptism generally, and especially to the interest which little
children have in the affections of the Saviour; I propose,
therefore, to address you this morning from</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mark</span> x,
13&ndash;16.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And they brought young children to him that
he should touch them; and his disciples rebuked those that
brought them.&nbsp; But when Jesus saw it he was much displeased,
and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me,
and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.&nbsp;
Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.&nbsp; And he
took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scene presented by these words is indescribably lovely;
and the eye that contemplates it, must affect the heart of the
beholder with every tender and grateful feeling.&nbsp; It
exhibits the eternal Son of God holding in his arms the infant of
a day; laying his mighty and merciful hand upon its head; and
bestowing upon it his own effectual blessing.&nbsp; Wonderful as
all this is, it is however in perfect harmony with the whole of
his character, and of the great work which he came to
accomplish.&nbsp; The infants <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>which were now brought to him,
ignorant and helpless as they were, were creatures which he
himself had formed, and which he had inspired with the breath of
life, and with the germ of all those intellectual and moral
faculties which would render them immortal and responsible to
God.&nbsp; He, therefore, who guides the flight of the sparrow as
well as of the archangel, cares for the infant as well as for the
man; and he has testified his care, not only now, when he was
gathering these lambs in his arms, but through all the preceding
dispensations of his mediatorial reign.&nbsp; His disciples,
influenced by the same mistaken feelings which led the multitude
to rebuke the blind men, who cried for mercy to the son of David,
rebuked the parents, who were now desirous that their infants
should receive his gentle touch, and &ldquo;that he should put
his hands on them and pray;&rdquo; &ldquo;but when Jesus saw it
he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the
kingdom of God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;of such is the kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; When heaven was more immediately his
residence, he had there been accustomed to gather little children
in his arms, and to introduce them to the joys and royalties of
his celestial palace; and when that palace is completely
furnished with guests, little children, who have died in their
infancy, will constitute no small portion of the glorious
number.&nbsp; When he first formed a church on earth, and
separated the subjects of his own kingdom from others, he did so
<i>with an express reference to the children of his people</i>;
and he appointed the ordinance of circumcision to be administered
to them at eight days old, as the token of his <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>everlasting
promise, &ldquo;I will be a God unto thee, and unto thy seed
after thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; When that church was reorganized by
Moses, and during the whole period of the Jewish dispensation,
the same divine regard to infants is manifested, and their
dedication to God, by &ldquo;the token of the covenant,&rdquo; is
continued.&nbsp; When, during that dispensation, the gospel times
of the church are predicted, children are always represented as
sharing in the same privileges which they had been accustomed to
possess; for then, says Isaiah, &ldquo;the people shall not
labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the
seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now in the fulness of time, when Christ
himself personally appears in the world, he manifests the same
regard to little children that he had shown from the
beginning.&nbsp; When they were brought to him, &ldquo;he took
them up in his arms;&rdquo; not indeed to baptize them, for he
never baptized any one, either infant or adult; but to
acknowledge their continued connection with his kingdom, and
their capacity for receiving, not only an important sign, but the
spiritual blessings which that sign denoted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
such,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the kingdom of God,&rdquo; or, as
the phrase signifies, of such is <i>the church</i> of God; and
their being thus of his church, is given as the reason why they
should be brought to him as the head of the church.&nbsp; Having
thus declared that infants, under the gospel dispensation,
sustained the same relation to his spiritual kingdom which Jewish
infants had sustained, he proceeds to treat them
accordingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He put his hands on them;&rdquo; which
was a sign, as significant as the token of circumcision or of
baptism; for it was <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>the sign of his own blessing.&nbsp; &ldquo;He put his
hands on them,&rdquo; as Jacob put his hands on Ephraim and
Manasseh, when he lifted up his voice to heaven and said,
&ldquo;the angel that redeemed me from all evil bless the
lads;&rdquo; or as the high priest put his hands on the people,
when he blessed them in the name of the Lord; or as this great
High Priest himself afterwards lifted up his hands and blessed
his disciples, when he ascended from mount Olivet to
heaven.&nbsp; True it is, that, as infants, they could not
understand the meaning of this sign, any more than they could
understand the meaning of circumcision or of baptism.&nbsp; They
knew it not then, but they would know it hereafter.&nbsp; Yet,
notwithstanding their present ignorance, he did not refrain; he
put his hands upon them.&nbsp; And not only so, but as a
manifestation of his power and grace, he accompanied the sign
with the thing signified, &ldquo;and he blessed them;&rdquo; he
baptized them, not with water, but with his own blessing; and
thereby fulfilled his gracious promise, &ldquo;I will pour my
spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy
offspring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history which our text records is therefore the
consummation and the climax of a series of circumstances, which
are intended to show <i>the interest which the children of
believers have in the Saviour&rsquo;s kingdom</i>.&nbsp; And as
such we receive it with joy and thankfulness.&nbsp; There is, in
the heart of every christian parent, an earnest desire that his
children, as well as himself, should participate in the enjoyment
of spiritual blessings; and when he receives his new-born babe
into his arms, the first wish of his heart is to lay it on the
arms of Christ, and to <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>dedicate it to him for ever.&nbsp; So
strong is this feeling, that many persons, who deny infant
baptism, are so convinced of the desirableness of having some
mode of dedicating their offspring to God, that they hold a
special meeting for the purpose, in which the pastor of the
church sets their children apart by a solemn dedicatory
service.&nbsp; Even the ancient Greeks and Romans, guided
probably by imperfect tradition, as well as by the light of
nature, were accustomed, a few days after the birth of a child,
to carry it to the temple, and to commend it to some patron
deity.&nbsp; Instructed by the sacred scriptures, it is our
privilege to believe that He who awakens this desire in the
parental bosom, has appointed appropriate means whereby it may be
expressed and gratified; and that having instituted circumcision,
for such as were of the kingdom of God under the former
dispensation, he has now instituted baptism for such as are of
that kingdom, whether they be adults or infants.&nbsp; Some proof
of this has already been afforded by the history to which your
attention has been called; for if Christ has declared that our
children now, as well as formerly, are &ldquo;of the kingdom of
God,&rdquo; and if he gave to them the sign of his blessing, and
the blessing itself, &ldquo;can any one forbid water, that these
should not be baptized?&rdquo;&nbsp; But a variety of additional
evidence is still presented by this holy book, our only divine
and authoritative guide.&nbsp; The great question which we have
to ask on this subject is, <i>What is the will of Christ</i>? and
in seeking an answer to that inquiry, we are not to dictate to
the divine Spirit the manner in which the will of Christ is to be
made known to us, but we are thankfully to receive <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>it, in the
form of express command, or by any other mode of intimation that
may seem good in his sight.&nbsp; As there is, in the New
Testament, no <i>prohibition</i> of infant baptism, we are not
much concerned about a direct <i>injunction</i> to practise
it.&nbsp; There are some institutions belonging to former
dispensations of religion, which it was not necessary should be
formally re-enacted in the New Testament; because the will of
Christ respecting their continuance can be gathered by evidences
less direct.&nbsp; And as such a mode of teaching often requires
thoughtful and continuous reading to ascertain the mind of God,
we thereby gain a more extensive and intelligent acquaintance
with the scriptures, than we could have gained if every thing had
been stated as expressly and minutely as it is in the book of
Leviticus.&nbsp; The sabbath, for instance, was instituted at the
creation; it was continued during the patriarchal age; it was
observed during the Jewish dispensation till the time of Christ;
there is no command enjoining it in the New Testament; and though
some passages seem at first sight to discountenance the
observance of a christian sabbath, yet, from various remarks and
circumstances, incidentally scattered through the sacred book, we
are led to believe it to be the will of Christ that a sabbath
should be continued through the gospel dispensation, and that it
should be transferred from the last day of the week to the first;
and when we consult early ecclesiastical history, we find all our
convictions confirmed by the fact, that the first day of the week
was universally observed by the christian church as a day of rest
and worship.&nbsp; The ordinance of circumcision, in its
connection with baptism, is similarly <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>circumstanced.&nbsp; It was
instituted in the time of Abraham, and it continued to be
observed till the time of Christ, as a memorial of God&rsquo;s
everlasting covenant, and of the relationship which he had
established between believing parents and their children.&nbsp;
In the New Testament, we find that the ordinance itself is
changed from circumcision to baptism; just as the sabbath is
changed, from the seventh to the first day of the week.&nbsp; But
this is the principal change relative to the ordinance which the
New Testament declares.&nbsp; The old ordinance and the new have
precisely the same spiritual signification.&nbsp; Faith, in an
adult, was as necessary to precede circumcision, as it is now
necessary to precede baptism.&nbsp; Infants are quite as capable
of being baptized, as they were of being circumcised; and that it
is the will of Christ they should be baptized, is quite as
evident, from scripture testimony, as that the first day of the
week is the divinely appointed christian sabbath.&nbsp; Indeed,
their right to baptism seems to follow as a matter of course from
the fact declared in our text, and already illustrated, that
<i>our children now sustain the same relation to the kingdom of
God</i>, <i>that the children of believers did formerly</i>;
especially when we find that Christ not only said, &ldquo;of such
is the kingdom of God,&rdquo; but also that &ldquo;he put his
hands on them, and blessed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evidence which the New Testament affords of <i>the right
of infants to baptism</i>, is, however, abundant and various; so
much so, that scarcely an outline of it can be given in the small
space allotted to it in this discourse.&nbsp; The commission
which Christ gave to his apostles, refers not only to baptism,
but <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>also
to the christian instruction with which baptism is to be
connected, and which it is the great design of the ordinance to
secure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and teach all
nations, baptizing them unto the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Circumcision had
been confined principally to one nation, baptism is to be
extended to all nations; and as the sphere of the ordinance is
thus enlarged, is it at all likely that the subjects of the
ordinance are to be diminished? and that children, who were
admitted to the initiatory rite of the limited Jewish
dispensation, are to be excluded from the initiatory rite of the
universal dispensation of the gospel?&nbsp; If they had been
excluded, would the Jews have been silent about it?&nbsp; Would
they not have made it a subject of complaint? and would they not
have referred to the exclusion of their children as an argument
in favour of Judaism, and against Christianity?&nbsp; Undoubtedly
they would; and their silence is a strong presumptive evidence
that the baptismal, as well as the circumcisional commission,
included infants.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;teach,&rdquo; in the
former part of the passage, is not, in the original, the same
word as that which is translated &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; in the
latter part; but a word which literally signifies to disciple, or
to make disciples; so that the apostles were directed to
&ldquo;go and make disciples,&rdquo; not of Jews only, but
&ldquo;of all nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; And how was this to be
done?&nbsp; By baptizing and by teaching.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go and
make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The language of course implies that some
degree of instruction must go before baptism, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>in the case
of ignorant adults; but it is evident that <i>the</i>
&ldquo;<i>baptizing</i>&rdquo; <i>is to be introductory to
the</i> &ldquo;<i>teaching</i>&rdquo; just as circumcision
was.&nbsp; The first persons who would be baptized, would of
course be adults, as was the case when circumcision was
instituted; but there is nothing, either in the nature of
baptism, or in the terms of this commission, to exclude
infants.&nbsp; If it had been written, &ldquo;Go and make
disciples of all nations, circumcising them, and teaching them
all things,&rdquo; who would have said that the language excluded
infants from circumcision? and as baptism has succeeded
circumcision, and as it means the same thing, why should infants
be excluded by a mere change in the ordinance? especially as the
ordinance of baptism seems to be more suited to an infant than
circumcision was.&nbsp; If, nevertheless, it be maintained that
no person is to be baptized until he has been taught&mdash;taught
to observe all things whatsoever Christ has commanded, infants I
admit will then be excluded from baptism, and so for the most
part will adults be, and no persons can be baptized at all; for
such &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; comprehends the entire gospel, and
can be afforded only by long continued pastoral
instruction.&nbsp; The conduct of the apostles in executing the
commission, is, however, the best interpretation of its language;
and they considered that a single sermon to the three thousand,
and a single conversation with the eunuch, and a few words to the
jailor, were quite sufficient to precede baptism; and it was not
till after baptism, that the principles and duties of the gospel
were more fully taught; nor was it till after baptism that they
expected to perceive the fruits and the influences of <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>knowledge and
of faith.&nbsp; Instruction has therefore precisely the same
relation to baptism that it had to circumcision.&nbsp; It follows
rather than precedes.&nbsp; It does so, principally, in the case
of adults; it does so, entirely, in the case of children.&nbsp;
Baptism is merely an initiatory rite.&nbsp; It introduces the
disciple into the school; and it places him there, that he may be
&ldquo;instructed in the way of God more perfectly,&rdquo; and
taught not only to understand, but also &ldquo;to observe all
things whatsoever Christ has commanded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before the time of John the Baptist, &ldquo;divers
baptisms&rdquo; had been practised by the Jews.&nbsp; They appear
to have been in the habit of baptizing, as well as of
circumcising, the households which were proselyted from
heathenism to Judaism.&nbsp; They had therefore become familiar
with the ceremony, and consequently expressed no surprise that
John should come among them baptizing with water.&nbsp; John
indeed baptized unto repentance, and he refused this baptism to
none by whom it was requested.&nbsp; The apostles baptized unto
Christ; and therefore unto his death, his burial, and his
resurrection&mdash;unto all that he had done and suffered as the
mediator between God and man.&nbsp; And when they go forth to
make disciples of all nations, how exactly their practice
corresponds with the principles I have stated.&nbsp; These
apostles were Jews.&nbsp; They rejoiced in the exceeding great
and precious promise which God had made to Abraham and to them,
&ldquo;I will be a God unto thee, and unto thy seed after
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Authorised and encouraged by this promise,
they had been accustomed to disciple and to dedicate their
children by circumcision, which one of them calls &ldquo;a yoke
upon the <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>neck of <i>the disciples</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the day of
Pentecost, they began their work by declaring that the same
promise that had been the hope of Jews, was now given to the
Gentiles also, and to their children.&nbsp; They made the same
distinction between the children of Christian parents and other
children, that they had been accustomed to make between the
children of Jews and of heathens; for they called the one class
&ldquo;unclean,&rdquo; and the other class &ldquo;holy;&rdquo;
&ldquo;else were your children unclean, but now are they
holy;&rdquo; that is, externally and ceremonially holy&mdash;holy
as all children are who are discipled and consecrated unto
Christ.&nbsp; They made baptism, just what circumcision was, a
domestic as well as a parental service.&nbsp; They baptized the
family as well as the man; not as an extraordinary circumstance,
but as a common practice; just as our missionaries do, who are
placed in circumstances similar to those of the apostles; and who
baptize not only men and women, but families also&mdash;the
household of Stephanas; Lydia and her household; the jailor, and
all his straightway.&nbsp; When they wrote epistles to the
churches which they had baptized, they addressed children as well
as parents, and appealed to them in the name of the Lord.&nbsp;
And though the history of their labours extends over a period of
sixty years, yet in all that time they baptized none but Jews and
heathens; they never baptized any adult, who was an infant when
his parents were baptized; nor is there an instance upon record,
of a person who had been taught the gospel from his infancy, and
whose baptism was deferred till the maturity of life.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The
argument on behalf of the baptism of infants, which has been thus
briefly and imperfectly sketched, is full of conviction and
satisfaction; it is an argument for the understanding and the
heart; and it is in blessed harmony with all that a believer
desires on behalf of his children.&nbsp; We thank God for it; and
we thank God that having withheld a direct and formal precept for
the practice, he has been pleased to make known his will to us in
such a way, as enables us more fully to understand and to
appreciate his word.&nbsp; We consider that baptism in any case,
but especially to our children, is a valuable privilege; not
indeed as a mere ceremony, but as a token of the goodwill of our
heavenly Father.&nbsp; We regard the rainbow, not merely because
of the beauty of its arch, but because it betokens the covenant
which preserves the earth, and perpetuates the seasons.&nbsp; And
we regard baptism, not superstitiously, as if it contained some
mystic charm, but because it is a memorial of God&rsquo;s
covenant mercy, and the means by which our offspring are
dedicated and discipled.&nbsp; And we regard it too, because it
is an institution which is in beautiful harmony with the whole
system of revelation, in the Old and New Testaments.&nbsp; As the
substitute for circumcision, it connects the church at its
origin, with the church in its progress, and in its gospel
maturity.&nbsp; Whilst the promise, &ldquo;I will be a God unto
thee, and unto thy seed after thee,&rdquo; remains the same,
baptism now attaches to it the sign and the seal which was once
affixed by circumcision.&nbsp; The language and the conduct of
Christ to little children, in the case before us, is in perfect
harmony <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>with their baptism, and with all the principles on which
their baptism is practised.&nbsp; And when the apostles baptized
households; when they called the children of believers &ldquo;not
unclean but holy;&rdquo; and when they addressed children in the
epistles which they wrote to the churches, they adopted a style
of speaking and of action, which is not only in accordance with
infant baptism, but which would not have been used if they had
considered infants unfit for the ordinance.&nbsp; There are
indeed some christians, worthy of our esteem and love, who do not
perceive the force of this great argument, and who, therefore,
deny to their children the blessed privilege which we thankfully
enjoy.&nbsp; But it was not so formerly.&nbsp; The nearer we
approach to apostolic times, the more the practice of the church
accords with the principles I have advocated; and the most
careful and learned ecclesiastical historians bear undeniable
testimony to the fact, that for hundreds of years, immediately
after the apostles, <i>the baptism of infants was universal in
the church</i>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; In proceeding, from the subject of infant baptism
generally, to consider the baptism of the Prince of Wales, I
cannot, with propriety, refrain from adverting to some appendages
which will be made to his baptism, and which the Church of
England sanctions, but which I conceive to be unscriptural and
injurious.&nbsp; I allude principally to the sponsors; to the
sign of the cross; and to the doctrine of baptismal
regeneration.</p>
<p>The persons who are most interested in the baptism of a child
are its own parents.&nbsp; They are its natural guardians; and
they are its divinely appointed <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>ministers, to dedicate it to God, and
to plead on its behalf the promise of the everlasting
covenant.&nbsp; But in the Church of England, the parents seem to
be entirely excluded from participating in the service.&nbsp; The
twenty-ninth canon declares, not only that &ldquo;no parent shall
be admitted to answer as godfather for his own child,&rdquo; but
that &ldquo;no parent shall be even urged to be present&rdquo; at
its baptism.&nbsp; And when the parents are thus wrongfully set
aside, another class of persons are introduced, called
<i>sponsors</i>&mdash;godfathers and godmothers, who may indeed
be relatives or friends of the child, but who sometimes are
entire strangers, and who may be foreigners residing in a distant
country.&nbsp; The appointment of such persons, however ancient,
is not scriptural; and however desirable they may appear to be,
when the parents are dead, they are worse than useless when the
parents are living.&nbsp; The responsibility which these sponsors
take upon themselves is indescribably awful.&nbsp; Standing in
the presence of God, they solemnly promise and vow that the child
shall renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanity
of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh; that
he shall believe all the articles of the christian faith; and
that he shall keep God&rsquo;s holy will and commandments, and
walk in the same all the days of his life.&nbsp; Such are the
things which every sponsor engages shall be done; and I ask,
ought any human being to enter into such an engagement?&nbsp; If
he does enter into it, will the Lord hold him guiltless if he
does not fulfil it?&nbsp; And yet how often is this solemn vow
addressed to God, by the thoughtless and profane?&nbsp; <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>And how many
sponsors, when they have made it, never afterwards care for the
soul of the child, and perhaps never afterwards see its face.</p>
<p>In imitation of the Church of Rome, the Church of England uses
<i>the sign of the cross</i> in baptism; and having poured water
on the child, the priest marks him on the forehead with a cross,
&ldquo;in token that hereafter he shall not be ashamed to confess
the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under his
banner.&rdquo;&nbsp; This ceremony is not authorized by the
Scriptures.&nbsp; The sign of the cross was never used by Christ
and his apostles, either as a part of baptism, or as an appendage
to it.&nbsp; The Church of England, therefore, has no right to
command it.&nbsp; By so doing, she renders imperative what Christ
has not required, and what many of his people deem a vain
superstition.</p>
<p>But the most objectionable part of the service, is that which
ascribes to baptism <i>regenerating efficacy</i>, by which the
soul of the child is said to be purified and saved.&nbsp; The
language used by the Church of England on this subject, is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Dearly beloved brethren, this child is
regenerate, and grafted into the body of Christ&rsquo;s
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We yield thee hearty thanks, most
merciful Father, that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this
infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for thine own child
by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I certify you, that in this case all
is well done concerning the baptizing of this child; who, being
born in original sin, and in the wrath of God, is now by the
laver of regeneration in baptism, received into the number of the
children of God, and heirs of everlasting <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>life.&rdquo;&nbsp; In accordance with these
declarations, the child himself is afterwards taught to say by
the catechism,&mdash;&ldquo;in my baptism, wherein I was made a
member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the
kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when this same child is
brought for confirmation, his baptismal regeneration is declared
and ratified by the bishop, when he says, &ldquo;Almighty and
everlasting God, who hast vouchsafed to regenerate these thy
servants by water and the Holy Ghost, and hast given unto them
forgiveness of all their sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this, you
perceive is the language not of a commentator but of the Church
herself, uttered by her formularies, in which she plainly,
emphatically, and repeatedly declares, that all the children she
baptizes are, by their baptism, spiritually regenerated, so as to
be the pardoned, adopted, and purified children of God.&nbsp; So
decidedly is this doctrine the belief of the Established Church,
that the liturgy seems to be constructed entirely on the
principle that all her members are spiritually renewed.&nbsp;
There is in it, confession of sin, and petition for pardon, such
as any regenerated person might offer, but there is in it no
prayer that any in the congregation may be born again, and
renewed in the spirit of their mind; for that is a change which
it is supposed has already taken place in baptism.&nbsp; If,
however, it should be thought that we attach too strong a meaning
to her language, listen to a statement contained in the charge,
which the present bishop of Exeter delivered to his clergy in the
year 1836.&nbsp; &ldquo;The church,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is a
visible body, into which its members are admitted by a visible
sign, the sacrament of the new life; in baptism is regeneration;
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>without it
we have no warrant of scripture to affirm that the new birth
takes place at all; without it we are yet in our sins, in a state
of spiritual death, of enmity with God, and of fellowship with
the arch enemy in his hatred, and in its everlasting
punishment!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, in the first place, this doctrine
of baptismal regeneration is <i>unscriptural</i>, and utterly
subversive of the gospel of Christ.&nbsp; No writer in the New
Testament ascribes spiritual efficacy to water baptism.&nbsp;
John declares that he could baptize with water only, and that
Christ alone could baptize with the Holy Ghost and with
fire.&nbsp; Paul thanks God that he had baptized but few of the
Corinthians, and declares that Christ sent him not to baptize but
to preach the gospel, which certainly would not have been the
case if baptism effected regeneration.&nbsp; There is indeed a
baptism, emphatically called the &ldquo;one baptism,&rdquo; which
does regenerate and save; but it is not water baptism; it is not
&ldquo;the putting away the filth of the flesh;&rdquo; it is not
ceremonial purification; but it is &ldquo;the renewing of the
Holy Ghost,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the answer of a good conscience
toward God.&rdquo;&nbsp; What has been said of circumcision, may,
therefore, with equal propriety, be said of baptism; &ldquo;He is
not a Christian who is one outwardly; neither is that baptism
which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Christian who is one
inwardly; and baptism is that of the heart, in the spirit, and
not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Secondly, the doctrine of baptismal
regeneration is <i>injurious to the souls of men</i>.&nbsp; There
is a strong tendency in the depraved heart of man to exalt
ceremonies above morals, and to substitute ritual observances for
spiritual <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>religion.&nbsp; This has been done, both with
circumcision and with baptism.&nbsp; Some of the Jews taught
circumcisional regeneration, and declared that every circumcised
man was safe.&nbsp; Precisely the same error has been connected
with baptism; and equally injurious consequences follow.&nbsp; By
thus substituting a ceremony for faith and for divine influence,
and by ascribing to that ceremony what the Spirit of God alone
can secure, the word of God is made of none effect; spiritual
religion is reduced to a merely mechanical operation; the
worldly-minded and the immoral are taught to regard themselves as
pardoned and saved, because they have been baptized; and thus
thousands perish, whose blood will be required at the
watchman&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; And thirdly, this doctrine,
independently of other circumstances, renders our
<i>nonconformity with the Church of England</i>, <i>and our
dissent from its services</i>, <i>a solemn and imperative
duty</i>.&nbsp; When the present Prayer Book was issued on St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s day, in 1662, and an &ldquo;unfeigned assent
and consent&rdquo; to the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, and
to other antichristian doctrines, was demanded, no less than two
thousand clergymen refused their signatures.&nbsp; They could
not, with a good conscience, declare &ldquo;that the Book of
Common Prayer containeth in it nothing contrary to the word of
God;&rdquo; and therefore they retired from the church in which
they had ministered, and submitted to much poverty and
persecution.&nbsp; While we desire to value whatever is
scriptural in that church, and while we would love all who love
Christ, yet, with our convictions of the unscriptural character
of this doctrine, and of other doctrines taught in its liturgy,
conformity <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>would be a sin, a wilful and presumptuous sin, for which
we should have to answer in the great and terrible day of the
Lord.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Having thus stated the doctrine of infant baptism
as it is taught in the Scriptures, and having shown you what is
objectionable in the baptismal service of the Church of England,
I desire now to connect this latter part of the discourse more
immediately with the former; and therefore keeping in view the
baptism of the prince, I shall address you as subjects, as
parents, and as children.</p>
<p><i>As subjects of the British throne</i>, the feelings with
which you hailed the accession of our beloved Queen Victoria are,
I am persuaded, still fresh and joyous in your hearts.&nbsp; Her
youth; her education; her deceased father, and her still living
and honoured mother; her known attachment to civil and religious
liberty, inherited from her royal ancestors of the House of
Brunswick; and her virtuous character; all conspired to brighten
and to bless the day of her accession, and to fill our hearts
with joy and praise.&nbsp; Nor did we fail, as members of the
Church of Christ, to make her the subject of special, fervent,
and united prayer.&nbsp; And it is a most important and
impressive fact, that probably no sovereign, either in Britain or
in any other nation under heaven, ever ascended a throne
accompanied by more earnest and affectionate supplications than
Queen Victoria did.&nbsp; May all those prayers be answered, in
the divine bestowment of a long and prosperous reign, followed by
a holy and a happy eternity!&nbsp; Nor did the royal marriage
tend to lessen either our joy or hope.&nbsp; It enhanced them
both.&nbsp; Prince Albert is favourably known to <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the lovers of
protestantism and of piety in this country, as the branch of an
illustrious family, which at the era of the Reformation,
protected and patronized the immortal Luther, when he was
kindling in Germany that sacred flame which rapidly spread
through this county, and consumed many of the corruptions and
abominations of popery.&nbsp; And now, the royal pair having
become parents the second time&mdash;the parents of a prince, and
heir apparent to the British throne, we earnestly pray that his
baptism may be accompanied and followed by an unction from the
Holy One, and that he may grow, as the Babe of Bethlehem grew,
&ldquo;in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with both God and
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vast indeed is the influence and the
responsibility to which, as a British prince, he is probably
destined; and much indeed, under God, will depend on the
education he may receive; on the talents he may possess; and
especially upon the moral and religious character he may
acquire.&nbsp; In his reign, if he be spared to reign, and if not
before his reign, rank and wealth may have to yield more of their
influence to intellect and character, and the many may have to
take a still greater share in those national affairs which are
now principally conducted by the comparatively few.&nbsp; Ancient
monopolies, however serviceable they may have been in former
times; and ecclesiastical establishments, injurious at all times,
will have to endure a more searching examination than they have
even yet experienced, and will probably have to give way to
better institutions.&nbsp; And in the prospect of these
changes&mdash;changes which seem demanded by the interests of the
nation and of the Church of Christ: <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and changes which will require, in
their introduction and completion, much of wisdom, human and
divine, we feel the necessity of constant earnest prayer, that
our rulers and our fellow subjects may be all under the guidance
of &ldquo;Him, by whom kings reign, and princes decree
justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Believing too that the principles, on which
the congregational churches in this country are founded, are
scriptural principles, and that they are favourable to civil and
religious liberty, to all the national interests, and to the
purity and progress of christian truth, we desire to maintain
them, as our forefathers did, firmly and devoutly; especially
now, when attempts are making to extend among us the
superstitions of popery, and the fatal results of priestly
domination.&nbsp; If the existence of an Established Church in
this country, renders us dissenters, we trust that we are not
dissenters from the Church of Christ.&nbsp; Our motto is,
Conformity to the Church of Christ in every thing; and
nonconformity to every church which has dissented from
Christ&rsquo;s institutions.&nbsp; These are principles,
brethren, which are too sacred and important, not only to be
trifled with, but even to be advocated by carnal and worldly
minds.&nbsp; They belong to &ldquo;a kingdom which is not of this
world;&rdquo; and we pray that all by whom they are professed,
may be equally desirous &ldquo;to render unto Cesar the things
which are Cesar&rsquo;s, and unto God the things which are
God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addressing you <i>as parents</i>, who have dedicated your
children to God by baptism, I would affectionately remind you of
the duties which you owe both to yourselves and to them.&nbsp;
The apostle tells you that &ldquo;they are not unclean but
holy&rdquo;&mdash;holy, as the <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>sabbath and the temple were; and holy
as all children are who are dedicated to God by a religious
rite.&nbsp; When you brought them to the waters of baptism, you
thereby testified your conviction of their depravity and of their
need of cleansing grace; you thereby testified your belief that
the great promise, &ldquo;I will be a God unto thee, and unto thy
seed after thee,&rdquo; which was once to the Jews, is now unto
you and unto your children; and at the same time you testified
your intention &ldquo;to teach them to observe all things
whatsoever Christ has commanded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember then, that
the great and blessed privilege which you have enjoyed, is
connected with corresponding obligations.&nbsp; Having given your
children to God by baptism, you are to regard them as being
peculiarly his; and you are to regard yourselves not as their
proprietors, but as trustees, appointed by Christ, to train them
up for the church, and for the service of their Lord and
Master.&nbsp; Baptism, you are aware, does not constitute a man a
member of any particular church; but it gives him a ceremonial
qualification for membership.&nbsp; And this is just the position
in which baptism has placed your children.&nbsp; They are
candidates for communion with the church; and, as &ldquo;holy
children,&rdquo; they possess the ceremonial qualification for
communion.&nbsp; Now, as you have been the means of giving them
the one qualification, you may also be the means of giving them
the other.&nbsp; You may, through the divine blessing, be the
means of making them spiritually as well as ceremonially
holy.&nbsp; And it is the will of God that you should.&nbsp; For
that purpose he has committed them to your charge; for that
purpose he has authorized <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>you to baptize them; and for that
purpose he has given you the blessed assurance, &ldquo;Believe on
the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, <span
class="GutSmall">AND THY HOUSE</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the
great principles on which the God of mercy acts, in his moral
government of the world, is to bless children for the sake of
their believing parents; and the number of such children which
are received into our churches, and which are engaged in the
christian ministry, is an evidence of the fact, and of the
faithfulness of Him by whom the promises are made.&nbsp; But you
are not to expect this blessing unconditionally; nor are you to
expect it from the mere fact of their baptism.&nbsp; When God
made promise to Abraham, and gave him the sign of circumcision as
the token of his covenant, he made the fulfilment of that promise
to depend on Abraham&rsquo;s personal piety, and on the religious
education of his children.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abraham,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the
nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.&nbsp; For I know
him, that he will command his children and his household after
him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and
judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath
spoken of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in like manner you are to be
known to God, and to command your children and your household
after you, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and
judgment.&nbsp; As parents, you are to have and to exercise
authority in your own families.&nbsp; You are not only to advise
and to recommend, but you are to command, and to be obeyed.&nbsp;
You are &ldquo;to rule your children and your own houses well;
having your children in subjection with all gravity; teaching
them <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>to
observe all things whatsoever Christ has commanded;&rdquo; and
ever, acting in accordance with the vow which you have made,
&ldquo;as for me, <i>and my house</i>, we will serve the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having baptized your children unto Christ, you
have motives and encouragements of the most powerful and
constraining character, to &ldquo;bring them up in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; You can appeal to them
by the fact that you have given them to Christ; that you
&ldquo;have opened your mouth unto the Lord concerning them, and
you cannot go back;&rdquo; and that, by their baptism, they and
you have incurred responsibilities from which neither of you can
be released, and which should lead both of you to serious
consideration, and to unreserved consecration to God.&nbsp; Oh!
then, christian parents, use the power and the privilege which
God hath thus put into your hands; use them in connection with
earnest and unceasing prayer; enforce them by consistent and holy
example; cherish &ldquo;the full assurance of hope&rdquo; that,
through the grace of God, you will succeed.&nbsp; And you shall
succeed; &ldquo;the Lord will bring upon you that which he hath
spoken.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He will be a God unto you, and unto
your seed after you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your house shall be saved as
well as yourself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will pour out his Spirit upon
your seed, and his blessing upon your offspring; and they shall
spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water
courses.&nbsp; One shall say I am the Lord&rsquo;s; another shall
call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe
with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of
Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, I appeal to you as <i>baptized children</i>; and
while I congratulate you on the blessed privilege <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>of having
been dedicated to God in your infancy, I would seriously admonish
you of the obligations and responsibility which your baptism has
imposed.&nbsp; Almost as soon as your existence commenced, you
were brought to an ordinance which, like the bow on the cloud, is
the sign of God&rsquo;s better and enduring covenant.&nbsp; When
you were almost as unconscious as the cloud on which the rainbow
shines, God fixed upon you the sign and the seal of his new
covenant righteousness.&nbsp; He did not wait till you had
attained to years of maturity, or even of intelligence; but
before you could understand, he taught you; before you could
hear, he spoke to you; and his significant language was,
&ldquo;You are come into a world of mercy as well as of pollution
and sin; and this baptismal water is an emblem of that
&lsquo;blood of sprinkling,&rsquo; through which mercy may come
to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; That baptism, beloved young friends, has
brought you into circumstances of great responsibility.&nbsp; It
is an evidence that you were born into the midst of gospel
privileges.&nbsp; It is a mark by which you are known to have
been dedicated to God.&nbsp; It is a mark which never can be
obliterated; which no human efforts can wash out; which you will
carry to the grave; and which will be found upon you at the bar
of God!&nbsp; With this mark upon you, there you will stand, not
as &ldquo;unclean children&rdquo; and heathens, but as &ldquo;the
children of the kingdom;&rdquo; as disciples who have been
introduced into Christ&rsquo;s school, and taught to observe all
things whatsoever Christ has commanded.&nbsp; By that baptism
which you have received, and by those commands which you have
been taught to observe, you will then be judged.&nbsp; And what
will be your end, if you obey not the <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>gospel of God!&nbsp; In your case
especially, obedience is expected, because, in your case, it is
especially encouraged.&nbsp; If there was much profit in
circumcision, because that unto them were committed the oracles
of God, how much more profit is there in baptism, because to you
are committed, not only the Old Testament oracles, but the
New.&nbsp; If he that was circumcised became thereby &ldquo;a
debtor to do the whole law,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to fulfil all its
righteousness,&rdquo; how much more are you, the baptized,
debtors to believe and to practice &ldquo;the glorious
gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; You have been baptized unto Christ, have you
put on Christ?&nbsp; You have been ceremonially qualified for
church communion, are you spiritually qualified?&nbsp; You have
been dedicated to God by others in your baptism, have you
dedicated yourselves to God?&nbsp; You have been &ldquo;born of
water,&rdquo; have you been &ldquo;born of the Spirit?&rdquo;
&ldquo;for except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, except
you go back to your own infancy, and become spiritually now, what
you were naturally then&mdash;&ldquo;except ye be converted and
become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven;&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span class="smcap">verily I say unto
you</span>, <span class="smcap">whosoever shall not receive the
kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter
therein</span>.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
